These files are a collection of the skills I have accumulated by taking the Microsoft Excel courses through Ted Rogers Bootcamps. The number with each file 
corresponds to the level of difficulty of the course, with 1 being the lowest and 3 being the highest. Through these bootcamps, I have gained hands-on practice 
with taking large amounts of data and manipulating them to be summarized and visualized in a convenient format. Highlighted skills I learned include VLOOKUP, 
data cleaning, utilizing formulas, and creating charts and dashboards.
