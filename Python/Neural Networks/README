I created this assignment as a part of my Artificial Intelligence in Business Course. The task was to build a neural network using PyTorch to predict
the outcome of a given Breast Cancer data set. I then visualized the ongoing results of the neural network during training to display the inverse
relationship between accuracy and loss in my model as the number of epochs increased. These values would likely change if I were to increase the number
of epochs to greater than 100, which is why I kept the epochs set to 100. Overall, I was able to achieve high performance metrics of accuracy,
precision, and recall, with a minimal loss.
