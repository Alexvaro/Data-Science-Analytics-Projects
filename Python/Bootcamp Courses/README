These files are a collection of the skills I have learned in Python through the Ted Rogers Bootcamps. I am able to use Python to sort, load, visualize, and analyze
data in order to draw meaningful conclusion from this analysis. I am also familiar with classes, objects, methods and loops that are commonly used in Python
programming.
